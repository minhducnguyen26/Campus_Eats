### About Campus Eats

During the Summer of 2021, my team of 3 Computer Science major students came togther and decided to build an on-campus food delivery web app to offer to Dixie State University. For this project, I was responsible for building the front-end of the web app using Vue.js. It was a really fun project and I have learned a lot, from how to work with a JavaScript framework, how to improve my UI/UX skills, how to communicate with the server/database, and so much more. Even though Dixie State University did not support our project so we couldn't go with it all the way till the end, I still believe that the skills and technologies we learned and used will help us a lot as we go furthur in this field.
